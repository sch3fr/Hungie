# Hungie App

~~This is a learning repo for my summer project - an Android app using Xamarin.~~
This was supposed to be an android app built on Xamarin, but since it is losing support soon, I'll switch to MAUI framework.
The app is going to be sort of a food diary. Users will be able to take pictures of their food, add time, description and calories.<br/><br/>
After doing some more research I figured out that I don't have to wait for MAUI, I'm better off just starting developing the app now and then trying to port it to MAUI later. I don't have to wait to start studying.

So far the project is in as early stage as it can be. I have the idea, and I know what I'm going to use to build it. But I still haven't decided yet on features, UI desing, etc. I know next to nothing about MAUI, so I'm looking forward to learning about it!
