# Hungie App

PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT XAML FORMS FIRST.

This is a learning repo for my summer project - an Android app using Xamarin. 
The app is going to be sort of a food diary. Users will be able to take pictures of their food, add time, description and calories.

## ToDo
Here is a list of things I need to do so far.  
1. Explore Xamarin  
2. Design UI  
3. Code it!
