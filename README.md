# Hungie App

PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT XAML FORMS FIRST.

~~This is a learning repo for my summer project - an Android app using Xamarin.~~
This was supposed to be an android app built on Xamarin, but since it is losing support soon, I'll switch to MAUI framework.
The app is going to be sort of a food diary. Users will be able to take pictures of their food, add time, description and calories.

So far the project is in as early stage as it can be. I have the idea, and I know what I'm going to use to build it. But I still haven't decided yet on features, UI desing, etc. I know next to nothing about MAUI, so I'm looking forward to learning about it!
