# Hungie App

This is a learning repo for my summer project - an Android app using Xamarin.<br/>
~~This was supposed to be an android app built on Xamarin, but since it is losing support soon, I'll switch to MAUI framework.~~<br/>
The app is going to be sort of a food diary. Users will be able to take pictures of their food, add time, description and calories.<br/><br/>
After doing some more research I figured out that I don't have to wait for MAUI, I'm better off just starting developing the app now and then trying to port it to MAUI later. I don't have to wait to start studying.

So far the project is in as early stage as it can be. I have the idea, and I know what I'm going to use to build it. But I still haven't decided yet on features, UI desing, etc. I know next to nothing about MAUI, so I'm looking forward to learning about it!
## UI notes
There are gona be several pages with bottom navigation bar. <br/>
The first page (home) is gonna have big round graph with calories and under that are gonna be todays food cards.<br/>
The second page (history or something) will have food cards from today and days before.<br/>
I'd like to add more pages, we'll see wether I'll come up with something useful.
